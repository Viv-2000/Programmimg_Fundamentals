# My School Management System

## Overview
The My School Management System is a comprehensive Python application developed to manage and analyze school data using the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. This project is designed to handle complex educational data structures and provide meaningful insights into courses and student performance.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Architecture**: Utilizes classes to encapsulate the logic related to students, courses, and results, ensuring code modularity and reusability.
- **Data Handling**: Reads and processes data from various text files that include detailed information about students, courses, and their results.
- **Dynamic Reporting**: Generates reports on student performance across different courses and calculates statistical data such as pass rates and average scores.
- **Extensible Framework**: Supports easy additions and modifications to cater to different educational requirements and scenarios.

## Installation
Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download the project files and place them in your desired directory:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

## Usage
Run the application from the command line by navigating to the project directory:
```bash
python my_school.py <result_file.txt> <course_file.txt> <student_file.txt>
```
Replace `<result_file.txt>`, `<course_file.txt>`, and `<student_file.txt>` with your actual file names containing the necessary data.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x

## Documentation
The application's code is thoroughly documented to explain the functionality and logic behind each class and method. This ensures that future modifications and enhancements can be made efficiently.

## Credits
This system was developed as part of the Programming Fundamentals course at RMIT University, aiming to give students hands-on experience with real-world software development scenarios.

## Developer
Developed by Vivek Aggarwal, a dedicated programming student at RMIT University. For further inquiries or suggestions, please contact me via my email.
