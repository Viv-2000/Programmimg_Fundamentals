# CineTicket OOP System

## Overview
The CineTicket OOP System is an advanced version of the initial CineTicket System, employing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This Python-based project serves as a robust platform for cinema managers to manage movie ticket sales, emphasizing modularity and code reusability through OOP.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Built using classes and objects, facilitating easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Dynamic Ticket Pricing and Discounts**: Implements methods for calculating total ticket costs, including discounts for reward program members and standard booking fees.
- **Comprehensive Data Handling**: Manages multiple types of data such as movies, tickets, and customer records using classes and file management.
- **User Interaction**: Features a menu-driven interface that guides the user through various functionalities, including purchasing tickets, registering for reward programs, and viewing cinema records.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Supports advanced features like group ticket purchases and handling of different customer types based on reward program membership.

## Installation
Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download the project and run it locally:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
Make sure to download and place the following text files in the same directory as the Python script:
- `customers.txt`
- `movies.txt`
- `tickets.txt`
- `bookings.txt` (optional, only if you want to load previous bookings)

## Usage
Navigate to the project directory and execute the main script:
```bash
python CineTicketOOPSystem.py
```
Interact with the system via the command-line interface, selecting options from the menu to perform different operations.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x

## Documentation
The code is fully documented, explaining the purpose and functionality of each class and method. Inline comments are used extensively to enhance code readability and maintenance.

## Credits
This project is a part of the Programming Fundamentals course at RMIT University, designed to introduce students to the practical application of object-oriented programming concepts.
