# CineTicket Index System

## Overview
The CineTicket Index System is an alternate implementation of the CineTicket System, utilizing indices for enhanced data handling. This Python project simulates a movie ticketing interface for cinema cashiers or managers, focusing on efficient data manipulation and retrieval.

## Features
- **Indexed Data**: Leverages the power of indices for quick access and manipulation of customer and movie data.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Guides users through the process of ticket booking with prompts for customer details, movie selections, and ticket types.
- **Dynamic Pricing Calculation**: Automatically calculates total costs, incorporating discounts for members of a rewards program and applicable fees.
- **Robust Data Structures**: Employs advanced data structures to organize and manage movie and customer information efficiently.
- **Menu-Driven Operations**: Allows users to navigate through various functionalities such as ticket purchasing and adding movies through a simple menu system.
- **Enhanced Functionalities**: Supports complex transactions like purchasing multiple ticket types in one go and provides detailed analytics on sales and movie popularity.
